= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== Curl request
----
include::{snippets}/juke/http-request.adoc[]
----
----
include::{snippets}/setting/http-request.adoc[]
----

== Request Parameter
----
include::{snippets}/juke-model/request-parameters.adoc[]
----
----
include::{snippets}/juke-setting/request-parameters.adoc[]
----

== Curl response
----
include::{snippets}/juke/http-response.adoc[]
----

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
