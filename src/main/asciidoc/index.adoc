= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== Curl request
include::target\generated-snippets\juke\http-request.adoc[]
include::target\generated-snippets\setting\http-request.adoc[]

== Request Parameter
include::target\generated-snippets\juke-model\request-parameters.adoc[]
include::target\generated-snippets\juke-setting\request-parameters.adoc[]

== Curl response
include::target\generated-snippets\juke\http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
